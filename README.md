# HybridForcePositionNN
Neural Network Based Hybrid Force/Position Control


This project consist of an assembly task operates in three steps:
  1. wide amplitude displacements are performed by
     the 2D Cartesian robot in order to bring the
     assembly parts to close vicinity.
  2. perform the proper location of the moving part
     using an external vision sensor.
  3. The assembly or the final insertion is performed.
